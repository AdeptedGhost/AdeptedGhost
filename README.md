- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @AdeptedGhost
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Minecraft and Programming
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java and C# in my personal time, but Delphi at school
I am currently working on writing Minecraft plugins using Java. I will be soon opening a Fiverr account where YOU can request a plugin to be made!
My main goal is to get experience with writting Java and learn more about the language itself.
